# Uber-Data-Analysis-Project

## Introduction:
Uber has revolutionized the transportation industry with its innovative ride-sharing platform, connecting passengers with drivers through a seamless mobile application. Since its launch in 2009, Uber has grown exponentially, expanding its operations to over 900 metropolitan areas worldwide. As a result, the company has accumulated vast amounts of data, providing valuable insights into various aspects of urban transportation.

## Objective:
The aim of this data analysis project is to explore and analyze Uber's extensive dataset to uncover trends, patterns, and valuable information that can help us better understand the dynamics of this evolving industry. By delving into the data, we can gain insights into factors such as demand patterns, rider behaviour, and the impact of external factors on Uber's operations.

## Project Structure
The project is structured as follows:

### 1. Data Collection:
The Uber ride data used in this analysis was obtained from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/zusmani/uberdrives). This Kaggle Uber dataset contains information about 1155 rides by a single Uber user in 2016. The features include the trip date, source, destination, distance travelled, and purpose.

### Data Preprocessing: 
The data is cleaned and transformed the raw data into a format suitable for analysis. This involved handling missing values, removing outliers, and performing necessary data transformations. 

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
The data is analyzed with Python libraries like Pandas, Numpy. Data visualization is done by using Matplotlib and Seaborn.

### Key Findings: 
* There are two categories for each ride - business and personal. Most of the rides (around 90%) belong to the business category.
* Top 4 purposes of the ride are - meeting, meal/entertainment, errand/supplies, and customer visit. 
* Top 4 locations for both start and stop are - Cary, Morrisville, Whitebridge, and Gurahm.
* Most of the rides are started during the afternoon, and the least number of rides are started at night.
* Most rides were completed during December and November. A good number of rides are also distributed across Feb, March, June, and July. August has the least number of rides.
* Maximum number of rides are requested on Friday, and Wednesday has the least number of rides.
* October has the highest average for the duration but has less number of rides based on the previous explorations.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis conducted, we can conclude that the Uber ride data provides valuable insights into ride patterns, customer preferences, and operational efficiency. The findings suggest potential strategies for improving driver allocation, optimizing routes, and enhancing the overall customer experience.

### Future Work:
- Incorporating external data sources, such as weather or events data, to understand their impact on ride demand.
- Implementing real-time analytics and monitoring to make data-driven decisions in near real-time.
- Developing predictive models to forecast ride demand and optimize driver allocation in advance.

### Dependencies:
 - Python 3.8
- Pandas 1.3.0
- NumPy 1.21.0
- Matplotlib 3.4.2
- Seaborn 0.12.2
